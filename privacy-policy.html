      <p>1. Introduction<br/><br/>WOMBO Studios Inc. ("WOMBO," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the information you share with us.  This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard personal information when you interact with the Compute Network—our distributed computing software, SDKs, dashboards, websites, and related services (collectively, the "Services").  By accessing or using the Services, you agree to the practices described below.  If you do not agree, please discontinue use.<br/><br/>2.
